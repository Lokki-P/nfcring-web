<h1>Non-obvious Terms used</h1>

  <li>A ring supplied by McLear Ltd has developed a fault within a 12 month period and there are no signs of foul play.&nbsp; Kickstarter backers will get a 2 year warranty, however we can only guarantee one &quot;like for like&quot; replacement. This is due to the variety of rings we offered during Kickstarter that we won&#x27;t offer in the future. Future replacements after the one guaranteed &quot;like for like&quot; will be from our available range.</li>
  <li>A ring supplied by McLear Ltd does not fulfill the Quality Assurance criteria - <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;github&#x2e;com&#x2F;JohnMcLear&#x2F;nfc&#x2d;ring&#x2d;specs&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quality&#x2d;Assurance&#x2d;Procedure">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JohnMcLear&#x2F;nfc-ring-specs&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quality-Assurance-Procedure</a></li>

      <li>Purchasing an additional second ring at a heavily discounted rate.</li>
      <li>Sending their current ring back and receiving a replacement ring in due course.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Should a similar color size ring option not be available, the ring bearer should be offered one of the same value rings available in the NFC Ring catalog,</li>
  <li>The ring bearer should always be notified of replacement ring lead time,</li>
  <li>The ring returned by the ring bearer must be in new condition. (No marks or scratches)</li>

<h2>The Refund Process</h2>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li>The ring bearer should send the faulty ring back to the UK&#x2F;US distribution point.</li>
  <li>If requested, a replacement ring will be sent out free of charge at the time of receipt - or else a refund should be issued via cheque. 
    Note: Refunds via bank will be possible for pre-orders and orders (not for crowd-sourced orders)
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>Should a ring bearer send a ring back and it not be received by McLear Ltd, tracking information should be provided that provides proof of shipping.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>United States of America / Canada should be sent to "Returns @ McLear Ltd, 158 evergreen rd, boulder creek, CA 95006, United States"</li>
  <li>Rest of the world orders should be sent to "Returns @ McLear Ltd, Newby School House, Ryan Street, Bradford, West Yorkshire, BD5 7DQ, United Kingdom"</li>

<h1>Questions / Scenarios:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>What if the app doesn&#x27;t work with my phone?<br>
  The ring can be returned for a refund</li>
  <li>What if the app stops working after 30 days?<br>
  The NFC Ring unlock app comes with a warranty like any software you purchase. This warranty is limited to the verification and ring registration functionality of the app.</li>
  <li>What if I lose my ring but need exactly the same ring inlays?<br>
  There is nothing McLear Ltd can do about this. You will have to purchase a replacement ring.</li>
  <li>Is there any possibility to organize back shipping from UK, for example in Switzerland where the shipment costs more than a new ring?<br>
  Sadly no, maybe in the future when we expand we will find a way to make this feasible, but for now the best we can offer is shipping back to the UK or the US.</li>
  <li>Is there a problem with overloading the ring involuntary during checkout (like the shops do with the RFID security tags)?<br>
TLDR; No. (See previous document revisions for full explanation.)</li>
