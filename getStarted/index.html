<h1>Congratulations on finding your phones Sweet Spot!</h1>
Thank you for joining the NFC Ring Journey, we really appreciate your support and we look forward to hearing about the amazing things you do with your NFC Ring.
Your NFC Ring can already do loads of different awesome things and to make it easier we provide some apps for your phone (Note this should be "an app" for WP)
- I want to use my NFC Ring to share a link to an online profile page or some other information, take me to this app! (Different link for Android / WP)
- I want to use my NFC Ring to unlock my phones lockscreen.  (Android only)

<!--
// We already have the logic and code for doing OS detection on a phone and providing the correct app..
// It's on https://github.com/mclear/nfcring-web/blob/apps-page/apps/index.html
