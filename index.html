<h3>The future</h3>
<p>
Because we believe NFC is the right choice for this we hope that all operating systems so all of our development is open source 
and available through github.  Creating an open source platform will also enable third parties to adopt the McLear Torus  
and consider making their devices NFC ready (We're looking at you Apple).  <a href='/roadmap.html'>Our end goal is to produce a ring that will make your day to day life better.  We invision being able to use your ring as a pedometer, to monitor your heart rate, we have big plans for the future and we want you to be part of our journey.</a>
</p>

<h3>Open working</h3>
<p>
We believe in sharing as much information as possible so we also publish useful links to documentation and other reference points on our github organization site.  This includes <a href="https://github.com/mclear/torus-designs">3d models so you can customize and 3d print your own ring at home.</a>
